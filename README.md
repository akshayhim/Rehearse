**Rehearse**

Rehearse is a web application that allows users to quickly get the main ideas and points of a book without having to fully read it. Users can read book summaries, save them in their collection and view their account details.

**Technologies Used** : 
**Frontend**: JavaScript with React and Material UI, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.
**Backend**: Node.js with Express, Babel and CORS server integrated, allowing for efficient and scalable server-side logic.
**Database**: It uses Firebase Firestore as its database, providing a powerful and flexible data storage solution.
**Authentication**: Firebase Authentication is used to provide secure, easy to use authentication for Rehearse users.
**APIs**: It uses the Open Library API to gather book details and integrates with chatGPT 3.5 Turbo API to generate book summaries, allowing for unlimited access to book summaries.

**Usage** : To use Rehearse, simply sign up for an account, search for a book using the search bar, and add it to your collection. You can then track your progress through each summary and view your account details at any time. Visit https://rehearse-fa0ab.web.app/ to get started.

> Note: To use the search functionality, fork the project in your local system and run the nodejs server and babel/cors server using the command `node server.js`. This will run both servers locally, and you can then use the search function as needed.

**Future Feature Ideas**:
Allow users to rate and review book summaries
Suggest related book summaries based on the user's reading history
Summary Progress Tracking
